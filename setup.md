### Samwise Pre-drive Checklist

##### 1. Double check the vehicle to make sure all wires are plugged in properly. At minimum, your vehicle should have...
- Power from the battery to the Pixhawk flight controller and the Sabertooth motor controller
- A transceiver
- A safety switch
- A buzzer

##### 2. Check for loose components, especially near the motors and gear train.

##### 3. Shake the vehicle or turn it upside down to check if anything comes loose. Secure any loose and dangling wires/components.

##### 4. Turn on the controller, making sure that the left stick (throttle) is centered and down. Double check the screen to make sure you have selected the correct vehicle.
