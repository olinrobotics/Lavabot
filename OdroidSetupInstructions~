INSTRUCTIONS:

To set up an odroid for communicating over mavros, install ros indigo and mavros:
	http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
	https://dev.px4.io/ros-mavros-installation.html

To run code on the odroid via ssh:
	ifconfig					// find ip address
	nmap 10.42.0.0/24				// use address from ifconfig
	ssh root@10.42.0.75				// use address from nmap
	odroid						// password for odroid
	scp MyProgram.py root@10.42.0.75:/root/		// do this step on your computer, not Odroid
	roscore						// start ROS
	roslaunch mavros apm.launch			// start mavros
	python MyProgram.py				// run script

To set up ROS between multiple computers:
	On each computer besides the master (the one running roscore):
		ROS_MASTER_URI=http://sam:11311/ 	// sam is the master machine
	All machines must be able to ping each other by name (e.g. ping sam)
	To set the addresses and names (make sure that each machine has a different name):
		vim /etc/hostnames
			192.168.16.97		sam
			192.168.16.196		frodo
	To change a machine's hostname:
		vim /etc/hostname			// edit hostname file
			sam				// replace the current name
		hostname sam				// to change name temporarily

To edit the name of the MAVROS node:
	vim /opt/ros/indigo/share/mavros/launch/node.launch


DEBUGGING TIPS:

If there is no route to host when you try to connect to odroid, attach a keyboard to the odroid and type the following commands:
	root			// username
	odroid			// password
	ifconfig eth0 up
	dhclient eth0

If topics exist but messages aren't being published:
	rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1

If roscore command crashes due to locale problems: (source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/454260/how-to-solve-locale-problem)
	sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
	vim /etc/default/locale 
		LANG=en_US.UTF-8

If you have trouble installing APM Planner, follow these instructions instead:
	https://github.com/rspandolfi/DaVinciChallenge-Build-a-Drone-Workshop/blob/master/APM-Installer/install.sh#L14
	You will need to add sudo to some of the commands.
