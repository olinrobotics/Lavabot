INSTRUCTIONS:

To set up an odroid for communicating over mavros, install ros indigo and mavros.
http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu
https://dev.px4.io/ros-mavros-installation.html

To run code on the odroid via ssh, type these commands into a shell on your computer:
ifconfig						// find ip address
nmap 10.42.0.0/24					// use address from ifconfig
ssh root@10.42.0.75					// use address from nmap
odroid							// password for odroid
scp MyProgram.py root@10.42.0.75:/root/			// do this step on your computer, not Odroid
roscore							// start ROS
roslaunch mavros apm.launch				// start mavros
python MyProgram.py					// run script

To set up ROS between multiple computers:
On each connected machine, run ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.75:11311/ where 10.42.0.75 is the address of the master machine (the one running roscore).

To edit the name of the MAVROS node:
vim /opt/ros/indigo/share/mavros/launch/node.launch


DEBUGGING TIPS:

If there is no route to host when you try to connect to odroid, attach a keyboard to the odroid and type the following commands:
root			// username
odroid			// password
ifconfig eth0 up
dhclient eth0

If topics exist but messages aren't being published, run the following command:
rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1

If roscore command crashes due to locale problems:
sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
edit the file /etc/default/locale to contain the line: LANG=en_US.UTF-8

If you have trouble installing APM Planner, follow these instructions instead:

You will need to add sudo to some of the commands.
