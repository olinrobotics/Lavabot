FUSE SPECS
Jeremy – 3.5.17

Fuses have holding current and trip current specifications. The actual amperage at which the fuse trips is somewhere between these two values and decreases at higher temperatures. I chose fuses such that the holding current is greater than the high end of current draw for each component to minimize the chance that a fuse trips under normal use.
